# Video Player Project
## Summary
My fourth eact Project assisted by Codeacademy as part of the Learn React course. The task was to create a fully functioning video player with a selection of videos to choose from. The functionality of the video player was split into one container component and two presentational components which follows React programming pattern rules.
